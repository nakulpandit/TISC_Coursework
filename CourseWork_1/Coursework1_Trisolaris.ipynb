    "\n",
    "## Section 1 : Instructions and important information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Important information about this project assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the assignment for the first coursework of MTH739 – Topics in Scientific Computing. This assignment is scored on a scale of 100, and will contribute 20% of your final mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read carefully through the paragraphs below, since they contain very important information about the submission deadline, procedures, expectations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consists of 3 problems, each containing a single goal with multiple component parts. You are expected and encouraged to attempt every problem in this assignment. Fractional marks may be awarded for meaningful partial solutions, for example, a description in words/pseudocode of what you would do in principle to solve the problem, or implement a test. It will always be better to write something rather than nothing, since you can only gain (you won't lose marks for wrong answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to provide working Python code that answers each question, and to **accompany your code with appropriate documentation of the code appropriate for new users who have a basic familiarity with python and ODEs (your colleagues on this course, for example!)**. In particular, you should provide at least a brief text paragraph (using the markdown cells) that explains what you did, and you should use appropriate naming and include meaningful comments inside your code where necessary, to make it clear what the code does. Failing to provide comments and/or documentation will mean you cannot access the maximum mark. Marks will also be available for defensive programming techniques including asserts and tests of key functionality, where appropriate. You need to use your judgement for this - the code and documentation should prevent a slightly confused user from doing incorrect things or breaking code, and check that you implemented things correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The marks available for each section are indicated below. The marks available will be split as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 70% for working code that correctly implements all of the requested components\n",
    "   - 10% for use of defensive programming techniques - asserts and tests implemented to prevent user error and check the code is functioning correctly.\n",
    "   - 10% for readability of code, following the agreed naming conventions of the course, appropriate commenting\n",
    "   - 10% for appropriate documentation of the code implemented in markdown format around the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read all sections and each question carefully before attempting an answer. This will help you to avoid misinterpreting the questions and you may be able to make your code more flexible at an earlier stage in order to be able to use it more efficiently later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are mainly expected to develop your own code to solve the problems, even though python may already have a library function that performs the same task. Since the goal is to show that you understand the methods and how they are implemented, you should in general write your own code for an algorithm from scratch unless use of a specific function is indicated (obviously still using basic numpy, scipy and sympy functions like `np.sin()`, `np.array()`, `sp.symbol()` etc is fine!). As a general rule, **do not use any functions outside of the sympy, numpy, matplotlib and scipy libraries**. You should not need to use any others, but if you are in any doubt, **just ask**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Submission procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use **this Jupyter Notebook** to develop your project, answer the questions, write the corresponding code, present the result in accordance to the requirements of each question, and include your comments and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add as many text or code cells as needed. If you like you can remove this section (Section 1) with the instructions - just make sure you read it first!.\n",
    "You are expected to submit this Jupyter Notebook filled in with all your code, answers, comments, and nothing else. Please **do not rename this file** - all the submissions are automatically associated to your QMPlus Student ID and so you do not need to add any identifier. Note that you cannot submit any additional file.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the submissions must be performed through QMPlus, using the appropriate submission system for this assignment -\n",
    "you cannot submit your attempt in any other way! Submissions received through other means, including emails **will not be considered and will score a zero**.\n",
    "Please read through the paragraph below about the submission deadline and the late submission policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Submission deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission deadline for this coursework is **17:00 UK time on Friday 21 November**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions received after that deadline will be treated in accordance with the College Regulations concerning late submissions. This means that late submissions will incur a penalty of 5% of the total marks for every day of delay (or fraction thereof), up to seven days after the submission deadline. For instance, a submission received with 24 hours of delay will incur a penalty of 10 marks of the 100 available. Any submission received more than 168 hours after the deadline stated above will score a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer will be available to answer reasonable questions about this assignment up until Wednesday 19th November 2024. You can contact the lecturer via email at _k.clough@qmul.ac.uk_. If information or tips are given to a student individually, this will then be communicated to the whole cohort via the course announcements, so everyone has the same guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Third-party material and plagiarism policy\n",
    "\n",
    "You must work independently on your project, and your submission should include only original material, code and comments, that you have produced by yourself. You are allowed to use any sources (books, internet, Google, etc.) to help you in completing this project, but you must cite them appropriately. The same applies to published code: if you use any publicly available code from a third party, you must cite the source appropriately, and specify what is your original contribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use ChatGPT to help you with debugging and finding functions you need, but you should not rely on it to structure your solution - this is the part that you need to learn how to do if you want to be good at coding, so you are wasting your time and money on this course if you use it. I would also advise you that those who used it in prior years (even not blindly, with modifications) generally got poorer marks, because this course is quite specialised. In particular, ChatGPT does not follow the course coding conventions unless prompted a lot, and its documentation sounds clever but usually makes no actual physical sense. Use it as an aid, not as a replacement for your own knowledge and judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to discuss the general approach to a question with your colleagues, but you cannot share your own code with colleagues or reuse code produced by your colleagues for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen Mary University of London has in place a very efficient system for automatic plagiarism detection, which draws on a database of several million books, webpages, research articles, dissertations, and submissions to university-level modules from all over the world. All the material submitted for assessment is automatically processed by this system, which produces a detailed plagiarism report. If I suspect that any of the submitted material is plagiarised, the marks of the corresponding piece of assessment will be withheld until you can demonstrate that the code or material is genuinely your own. Any suspect case of copying or plagiarism will be referred to the School and the College for investigation. The typical outcome of a plagiarism investigation might be the failure of the corresponding piece of assessment, the failure of the module, or even the withdrawal of an awarded title and the expulsion from the College in more serious cases. Please refer to the QMUL Academic Regulations for more information about the definition of plagiarism and the relative penalties: https://arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/student-appeals/assessment-offences/index.html"

    "## Section 2 : Coursework background\n",
    "\n",
    "This background will also be discussed in the Week 4 lecture, which will be recorded, so you should watch that if you did not attend.\n",

    "### 2.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad goal of the project is to write code to model coplanar stellar systems (i.e., all the motion is in the x and y directions) with up to three stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our solar system, we have only one star (the Sun!), and this dominates the motion of the other objects (like planets) that exist nearby. However, it is quite common to have two stars in a system, a so called \"binary\" star system, with the stars having a similar size and mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is very uncommon to have three similar sized stars in a close orbit (although a third can orbit much further out around the first two). Why? As we will see in this coursework, triple systems are subject to chaotic behaviour and will generally not be stable over long periods of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework uses the description of gravity developed by Newton, but it is not a complete description - that is given by Einstein's General Relativity. In the final part of the coursework, you will consider how modifications to Newtonian gravity can change orbital behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You really don't need to know anything about stars to do this coursework, you just need to solve the equations, but it can help to think about the physical system when you do this.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The equations to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations you need to solve are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $N$ stars, labelled by an index $i=1,2...N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of star $i$ is $(x_i, y_i)$, its mass is $M_i$. The goal is to solve for the positions of all the $N$ stars as functions of time, given the initial values of each star's position $[x_i,y_i]$ and velocity $\\left[\\frac{dx_i}{dt},\\frac{dy_i}{dt}\\right]$ at $t=0$. However, to solve for any one we will need to know the position of all the other stars - the systems are *coupled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(HINT Notice that this is a set of coupled 2nd order ODEs, so we need to apply what we learned in the course about dealing with higher order ODEs. How many dependent variables will we have in the state vector if we have N stars?)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODE for the x position of each star is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d^2 x_i }{ dt^2 } = \\sum^{j=N}_{j=1, j\\neq i} \\frac{M_j}{r^2_{ij}} \\cos(\\theta) \\quad \\quad (1)\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that stars are assumed to be point like objects and so they cannot collide or merge with each other (they simply pass through each other if found at the same location at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Note on units and initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work in units in which the masses of the stars are order 1 numbers, as are the values of $r_{ij}$ (roughly speaking you are choosing the length units to be equal to the mass units). Note that what I call an order 1 number here is anything in the range from 0.1-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our coordinate reference frame to be fixed to the stars' centre of mass, which means that we need to have zero initial net momentum in the system. This means that initially we should have:\n",
